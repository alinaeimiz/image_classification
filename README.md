## Introduction
This project involves training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for classifying images into specific categories. By using data preprocessing techniques and neural network architectures, this notebook aims to achieve high accuracy on the dataset.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (see `requirements.txt`)

## Setup and Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd image-classification-project
   ```
2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook image_classification.ipynb
   ```

## Usage
To run this project:
1. Open the `image_classification.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the steps in the notebook:
   - Load the dataset.
   - Preprocess images.
   - Build, train, and evaluate the CNN model.

## Notebook Structure
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Steps to import the dataset and preprocess the images, including resizing and normalizing.
2. **Model Building**: Code to create a CNN model architecture with layers optimized for image classification.
3. **Training**: Model training using the dataset, with adjustable hyperparameters.
4. **Evaluation**: Assessing model performance on a validation/test set and analyzing key metrics.
5. **Visualization**: Displaying accuracy and loss graphs over epochs to visualize the model's learning.

## Results
After training, the model is evaluated to determine its accuracy and loss. These results provide insights into the model's effectiveness in classifying images.
